    <p class="content"> I took Black and White photography during high school and weâ€™re required to work in dark room with chemical. I was in that course for 2 semester and the smell of chemical still haunted me. Not to mention it was an extremely long and tedious process, which is why I got fond of digital photography and photoshop later.</p>
