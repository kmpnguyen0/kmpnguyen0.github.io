    <p class="content">It was Christmas season so many flight got delay. Unfortunately my flight was among them. There were so many people waiting that I had to line up for 12 hours just to reach the booking table. Even so, they couldn't find any connecting flight that can get me back to Vietnam. I needed to wait at the airport for another 7 hours and eventually abled to catch a flight. It was the longest trip to get home so far, 37 hours in total.</p>
