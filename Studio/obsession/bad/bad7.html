    <p class="content">It was my first winter in US and I was not prepared for the cold. I have most of the essential such as coat, boots and sweater. But I didn’t have any hand protection. At the time I didn’t know that it’s important to apply lotion and wear gloves, so my hand was completely exposed to the cold. My hands won’t stop bleeding for the whole winter.</p>
