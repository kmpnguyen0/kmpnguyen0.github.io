  <p class="content">During my first year at Parson I worked on a project for Space and Materiality class. It's the Halloween Mask we needed to finish in one week for the Parade. The mask was fun to made, although I was in great time pressure and almost miss the parade. I had a good time and it was my first Halloween Parade in New York. I wore this masked into the parade with my friends and got stopped for photos multiple time.</p>
