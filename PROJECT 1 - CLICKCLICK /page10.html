The largest, blackest of 
the rats shook its head. 
It had an unpleasant sort 
of smile, Coraline thought.

<pre class="text3">

The rats formed a circle.

Then they began to climb on top of each other, carefully but swiftly, until they had formed a pyramid with the largest rat at the top. The rats began to sing, in high, whispery voices, We have teeth and we have tails We have tails we have eyes We were here before you fell You will be here when we rise. It wasn’t a pretty song. Coraline was sure she’d heard it before, or something like it, although she was unable to remember exactly where

	The other crazy old man upstairs was standing in the doorway, holding a tall black hat in his hands. The rats scampered up him, burrowing into his pockets, into his shirt, up his trouser legs, down his neck.  The largest rat climbed onto the old man’s shoulders, swung up on the long gray mustache, past the big black button eyes, and onto the top of the man’s head. In seconds the only evidence that the rats were there at all were the restless lumps under the man’s clothes, forever sliding from place to place across him; and there was still the largest rat, who stared down, with glittering red eyes, at Coraline from the man’s head. 
	<br><br>
	The old man put his hat on, 
	and the last rat was gone.
	<br><br><br><br><br><br>said the other old man upstairs.</p>

	<p class="text8">“Hello Coraline,”</p>
	<p class="text9">“I heard you were here. It is time 
	for the rats to have their dinner. 
	But you can come up with me, 
	if you like, and watch them feed.”</p>
	<p class="text10">There was something hungry in 
	the old man’s button eyes that 
	made Coraline feel uncomfortable. 
	“No, thank you,” she said. 
	“I’m going outside to explore.” 
	The old man nodded, very slowly.</p>
